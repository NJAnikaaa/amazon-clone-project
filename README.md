# Amazon Clone Project 🛒

Hey there! This is my Amazon homepage clone project. I'm really excited about this one because it's my first time recreating a real website! 

## What is this?

This is a practice project where I tried to copy Amazon's homepage using only HTML and CSS. It's not the real Amazon website - just me learning how big companies design their websites!

## Why I made this

I wanted to challenge myself and learn:
- How to build complex layouts
- How real e-commerce websites are structured
- How to use CSS Flexbox and Grid
- How to organize a bigger project
- How navigation bars actually work

## What's included in this clone?

✅ **Navigation Bar** - The black Amazon header with:
- Amazon logo
- Location selector (Deliver to Bangladesh)
- Search bar with category dropdown
- Language selector (EN)
- Sign in option
- Returns & Orders
- Shopping cart icon

✅ **Second Navigation Panel** - The dark gray menu bar with categories

✅ **Hero Section** - The big banner image

✅ **Product Cards Section** - Multiple shopping categories:
- Home essentials (4 mini cards in each)
- New home arrivals under $50
- Fashion deals
- Family & toys section
- Gaming section
- Clothing section
- Kitchen essentials
- And more!

✅ **Footer** - Complete footer with:
- "Back to top" link
- Multiple columns with links
- Amazon logo
- Copyright information

## Technologies I used

- **HTML5** - For the structure and content
- **CSS3** - For all the styling and layouts
- **Font Awesome Icons** - For the location pin, cart, search icons, etc.
- **Flexbox** - For the navigation and product layout
- **CSS Grid** - For the mini product cards inside each box

## How to run this project

Super easy! Just follow these steps:

1. **Download** all the files from this repository
2. Make sure the `images` folder is in the same directory as `index.html`
3. **Double-click** on `index.html`
4. Your browser will open and show the Amazon clone! 🎉

**OR** if you know how to use Live Server in VS Code:
1. Open the project folder in VS Code
2. Right-click on `index.html`
3. Click "Open with Live Server"

## Features I'm proud of

🎨 **Sticky Navigation** - The header stays at the top when you scroll!

🔍 **Working Search Bar Design** - It looks just like Amazon's search bar

📦 **Product Grid Layout** - Used CSS Grid to make those mini product cards

🎯 **Hover Effects** - Buttons and links change when you hover over them

📱 **Organized Code** - I tried to keep my HTML and CSS clean and readable

## Challenges I faced

### Problem 1: Navigation Bar Alignment
The navigation items weren't aligning properly at first. I learned about `justify-content: space-evenly` and `align-items: center` in Flexbox to fix this!

### Problem 2: Product Card Layout
Getting those 4 mini images inside each product card was tricky. I solved it using CSS Grid with `grid-template-columns: 3fr 3fr`.

### Problem 3: Images Not Loading
I had to make sure all image paths were correct. Learned about relative paths like `/images/filename.jpg`.

### Problem 4: Footer Styling
The footer had multiple sections with different background colors. I split it into separate divs and styled each one.

## What I learned

Through this project, I learned:

✨ How to structure a complex webpage with multiple sections

✨ The difference between Flexbox (for navigation) and Grid (for product cards)

✨ How to use sticky positioning for navigation bars

✨ How to create hover effects for better user experience

✨ How to organize CSS code with comments

✨ The importance of planning before coding

## Things that don't work yet (and that's okay!)

⚠️ The search bar doesn't actually search anything

⚠️ The dropdowns don't have real functionality

⚠️ Links don't go anywhere (they're just placeholders)

⚠️ The cart doesn't add items

**Note:** These features need JavaScript, which I'm planning to learn next!

## What I want to improve

Here's my TODO list for this project:

- [ ] Add JavaScript to make the search bar functional
- [ ] Make the dropdown menus actually work
- [ ] Add smooth scrolling animations
- [ ] Create more product cards
- [ ] Add a working shopping cart
- [ ] Make the "Sign In" button open a modal

## Screenshots

(I'll add screenshots here once I learn how to do that properly!)

## What's next?

After this project, I'm planning to:
1. Start learning JavaScript to add interactivity
2. Maybe try building a Netflix clone next? 🎬

## Lessons learned

**"Start simple, then add complexity"** - I learned it's better to get the basic layout working first, then add styling and details.

**"Comments are your friends"** - I added comments in my CSS to remember what each section does.

**"Break big problems into smaller ones"** - Instead of building the whole page at once, I did it section by section (navbar first, then hero, then products, then footer).

## Inspiration

This project was inspired by Amazon.com. I did this as a practice exercise to improve my HTML and CSS skills. This is NOT affiliated with Amazon in any way - just a student project!
